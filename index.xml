      <description>Dear reader,
Welcome to Coding Letters!
I will briefly tell you who I am, why I want to write, and what I will write about.
My name is Victor Trejo and I am passionate about programming. I was first exposed to programming during my Mechanical Engineering studies. During my eleven years in academia, I grew more and more interested in software development. This led me to work as a developer and after more than five years of experience, I do my best to continue learning every day.</description>
