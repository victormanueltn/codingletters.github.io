      <description>Dear reader,
As software grows complex and care is given to its structure, design patterns will appear. Sometimes they will be used intentionally and sometimes inadvertently. We might intuitively reach for patterns in our mental repertoire, or we might reinvent a long-known solution for a seemingly new problem. Regardless of our awareness of them, design patterns will show up.
If we strive to be intentional about the structure of our software, we will be better equipped by being able to recognize design patterns.</description>

      <description>Dear reader,
I have been thinking about functions and design patterns and how they resemble one another. They emerge similarly and they can be powerful communication tools. What differentiates them and why should we care?
Stumbling upon a function Let&amp;rsquo;s start by examining some code written in Rust. With it, a chipmunk is keeping track of the nuts surplus it gathers every month.
// January let nuts_found = 17; let nuts_needed_this_month = 62; let nuts_surplus = { if nuts_found &amp;gt; nuts_needed_this_month { nuts_found - nuts_needed_this_month } else { 0 } }; println!</description>

      <description>Dear reader,
Welcome to Coding Letters!
I will briefly tell you who I am, why I want to write, and what I will write about.
My name is Victor Trejo and I am passionate about programming. I was first exposed to programming during my Mechanical Engineering studies. During my eleven years in academia, I grew more and more interested in software development. This led me to work as a developer and after more than five years of experience, I do my best to continue learning every day.</description>
