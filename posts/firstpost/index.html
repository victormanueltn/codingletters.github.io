  <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>Welcome to Coding Letters!</p>
<p>I will briefly tell you who I am, why I want to write, and what I will write about.</p>
<p>My name is Victor Trejo and I am passionate about programming. I was first exposed to programming during my Mechanical Engineering studies. During my eleven years in academia, I grew more and more interested in software development. This led me to work as a developer and after more than five years of experience, I do my best to continue learning every day.</p>
<p>I have two main motivations for starting this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want to give back to the community. The internet is sometimes described as a hostile place, but we easily forget how often we receive quality help for free. This is my way of humbly saying thanks to all those who have selflessly helped me in my journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want us to learn together. Learning is better when it&rsquo;s a shared experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog, I will write about things I learn in the vast world of software development. This might evolve with time, but I am planning to write about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Programming languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsuspected parallelisms between programming and other disciplines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very excited about this new adventure and I am looking forward to receiving your feedback!</p>
