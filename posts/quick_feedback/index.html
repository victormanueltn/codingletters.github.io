  <p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>It is 1989. You finally reached the last level of Super Mario Bros and your heart is pounding. You have a single life left. You have never faced these obstacles, these pits, yet the adrenaline kicks in and you somehow reach Bowser. You pause. You take a breath. You go for it&hellip; but you miscalculated, a fireball got you. Game over. You have to restart. All over again. From the very beginning&hellip;</p>
<p>Fast forward 25 years and you just got Super Meat Boy. You make quick progress, and after a couple of hours, you feel more than at ease. You die and you respawn. You die often. Even before Meat Boy materializes, you are already pushing forward to go at it again. It is very hard. You do things that your younger self would have never imagined possible.</p>
<p>How come that you can accomplish wildly more difficult feats than your younger self? You are not getting any younger, and it&rsquo;s hard to admit, but you used to be way better at mental arithmetics. Faster reflexes are ruled out. Experience? Sure, there is definitely some of that although you practice significantly less because of adult life. So, what changed between 1989 and 2010?</p>
<p>Super Meat Boy allows you to try again from a point not far from where you died. Super Mario Bros asks you to restart from the very beginning. The time between retries is the main difference. When the feedback loop is long, the cost of failure is great. When the feedback loop is short, failure is just a stepping stone in a loop of experimentation.</p>
<p>The velocity of the feedback loop affects our coding in the same way. Programming history illustrates this point vividly.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, a developer would write their program in coding sheets. A keypunch operator would translate the sheets to a deck of punched cards. The deck of cards would be submitted to the computer room to be processed. The output would produce a printed report and you would get the expected results if everything went well. If it didn&rsquo;t, you would have to restart. All over again. From the very beginning&hellip;</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2024, and you are capable of compiling and running your program multiple times a minute. You don&rsquo;t need to wait for a report, you can actually inspect your program during execution with a debugger. The feedback loop has grown so short, that some people write their tests <em>before</em> their code!</p>
<p>The fast feedback loops that we enjoy today help us go farther. They render mistakes less punishing and make learning faster. Appreciating this point during architectural decisions or during the design of our test suites can benefit us. Taking care of our feedback loop in our day-to-day work contributes to our productivity and to our professional satisfaction.</p>
